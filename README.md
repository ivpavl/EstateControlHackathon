# ASP.NET WebApi + MVC project for hackathon!

## I was mainly responsible for the backend part of the project.

###### 24 hours was probably too short for us, so we didn't show the finished project.

###### But I left this project on GitHub and finalized it after a while.



### How to make it work?

Clone this repository

`git clone git@github.com:ivpavl/EstateControlHackathon.git`
